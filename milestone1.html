  <h2> Our App:</h2> <h3> Birth Control Tracker <h3>
  <h4> Birth control is an important part of girls' lives. However, there is not much education when being put on the pill. 
    Girls can do their own research before going to the doctor
    or ask their doctor specific questions regarding what kind of birth control they should or would like to be put on.
    Our research indicates that most girls get their information from Google. Google is a good resource, but there are many
    different kinds of birth control. Also, many girls don't know the time window that birth control should be taken in or 
    how birth control is less effective.
